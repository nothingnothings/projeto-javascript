I have put together a GitHub repo as an example of how to use Stubs, Spies and Mocks for JavaScript tests. This demo project shows how you would use a popular mocking library called SinonJS (Pronounced “sigh-non”) to Mock a simple in-memory store.














Stubs
Replace calls to databases or network requests. Stubbing (replaces) a function.

Pros:

Replace calls to db
Replace network requests with this
Force an error to test error handling




Spies
Spy on functions and see when or if they are called.

Pros:

Check if a method has been called with certain variables
Check if callbacks have been called, and how many times
